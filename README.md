### ABOUT BUNKIE
Bunkie is a project that is aimed at solving a unique problem among universities students, fortunately, our team is made up of individuals who students and those who have passed through the system. 
Bunkie will help connect students together who are in need of accommodation to stay with students who have accommodation already but need a roommate or students who are looking for other students so they can get a place together and share the cost.
Considering Security, Compatibility, and Location, Bunkie uses various features to help match suitably students together. see the documentation for more details.
